`Slide the Box`
===============

A grid-based iOS puzzle game. The aim is to reach the `red block` by sliding the `green box` (you) in order to navigate the maze. Levels are randomly generated and are always completable, I promise! If you don't beleive me then you can use the `hint` button (question mark) to help you find your way.

Make the levels more challenging by introducing `arrow tiles` which change your direction when you slide onto them.

Or introduce an extra dimension with `number tiles` which allow you to stop `x` spaces after the tile.

Finally, if you're really looking for a challenge then add `enemies` who hunt you down every slide you make. Get to the `red block` before they get to you!

However, if they catch you then it's game over!
